# Django Social Media App

## Project Overview

The **Django Social Media App** is a web-based application designed to provide users with a platform to connect, share posts, and interact with others. With core features such as creating, editing, and deleting posts, liking and commenting on content, and managing user profiles, this app aims to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within a two-week timeframe.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration, login, and logout functionality.
- **User Profiles:** Users can create, edit, and view profiles.
- **Post Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete posts.
- **Social Interactions:** Users can like/unlike posts and comment on posts.
- **Follow System:** Users can follow/unfollow other users and view followers and following lists.

The backend of this project is developed using **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**, with **SQLite** as the database. The system is built with scalability, security, and user-friendliness in mind, and it includes API documentation via **Swagger** or **Postman** for easy integration and testing.
